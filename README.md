### Covid notebook

Some example charts and a real-ish time data source.

For charts, I used [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) which can be installed with conda via running 

`$ conda install -c conda-forge altair vega_datasets` from the command line

Data is from [The covid tracking project](https://covidtracking.com/)
